# edu-app

Minimal cross-platform Flutter app (Hello World) with light/dark theme support.

Getting started

1. Install Flutter SDK: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/akhilraj/Workspace/edu-app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

To run on specific devices:

```bash
# list devices
flutter devices

# run on a specific device id
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

Notes

- The app shows a simple "Hello, World!" screen and supports `System`/`Light`/`Dark` theme modes via the AppBar menu.
- After first run, share your designs and I'll update the UI.
